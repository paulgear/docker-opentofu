# docker-terraform-utils

This is a fork of https://github.com/cmdlabs/docker-terraform-utils, which includes the following packages:

 * terraform
 * terraform-docs
 * tflint
 * AWS CLI
 * Azure CLI

The base image has been switched from Alpine to Ubuntu because I prefer it, and it works out 0.78 GB smaller.
